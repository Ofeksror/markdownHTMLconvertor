# Markdown HTML convertor
---
This is my final project for CS50 - a basic markdown editor that easily converts markdown syntax to HTML elements right after you press Enter. This project is highly inspired by Notion, a note-taking software I use in my day-to-day life.  You can also edit the already existing elements and add new lines in the middle.
